Year-clock
==========

An online year organizer which intuitively displays the year like a clock.

To-Do
=====

- Make added/deleted events appear/disappear immediately instead of having to refresh the page
- Add functionality to view years other than the current one
- Add functionality to view half of this year and half of next year to avoid an awkward jump on New Year's
- Indicate current year (and maybe date) in the center of the clock
- Add account system
