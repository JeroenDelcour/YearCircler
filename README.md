Year-clock
==========

An online year organizer which intuitively displays the year like a clock.

To-Do
=====

- Set clock radius to standard value and use viewport to scale to screen size. Only viewport and things that must not scale With screen size need to be set with JavaScript that way.
- Add functionality to view years other than the current one
- Add functionality to view half of this year and half of next year to avoid an awkward jump on New Year's
- Indicate current year (and maybe date) in the center of the clock
- Add account system
